# Profile_form
A website that takes in information and display it as a profile card

# How to use
Clone the repository or download it. 
Then run the command ```npm run dev``` directory of the project. After the terminal launches the project, the website can be access through local host at ```http://localhost:3000```. To stop the project, go to the terminal and enter control c to end the process.

To use the site, fill out the form in the home page and click submit. 
The form should redirect to a profile card page with the information displayed. 
There is a button in the lower left corner to return to the homepage

# Issues
There is an issue where on the intial form submit, the form doesn't redirect and instead reloads. I don't know the reason for this behavior. The way to bypass the issue is to reload on load or input the information again. The website should behave as normal after the initial submission.
